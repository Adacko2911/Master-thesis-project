Our findings suggest that the novel Multilevel Explicit Duration Hidden Markov model is a promising approach to accurately model durations of latent states. The simulation study showed that the MEDHMM with log-normal dwell time distribution is able to capture longer state durations ($\geq19.5$) with greater accuracy than the Multilevel Hidden Markov model. Moreover, the MEDHMM outperformed the MHMM in estimating other model-specific group-level parameters (e.g. emission means, and transition probabilities) when longer dwell times were assumed. Nevertheless, the proposed MEDHMM was shown to be not well suited for the estimation of shorter dwell times ($\leq3.5$) %as it consistently underestimated the values of expected state durations 
and struggled to capture the means of emission distribution correctly contrary to MHMM that performed well for these scenarios. The results also confirmed that the performance of the MEDHMM can be improved when the dwell time is different across states. Despite some limitations, this study can serve as a starting point for future investigation of Multilevel Explicit Duration Hidden Markov models. We believe that further research and refinement of this model could lead to better estimation results, as well as new insights and advancements in a variety of fields, including psychology and behavioural sciences.
