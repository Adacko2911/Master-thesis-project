 Panel A represent the group-level emission distribution scores on considered items observed in the data (red dashed line) and the distribution of scores multiply sampled from the MEDHMM (shaded grey distributions). Panel B represent the subject-level emission distribution mean scores on considered items observed in the data (red crosses) and the distribution of scores multiply sampled from the MEDHMM (boxplots).\label{ppc_out_mean_medhmm}
