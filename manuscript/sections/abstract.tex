 Recent technological advancements have made it easier to collect intensive longitudinal data, which enables researchers to closely study the dynamics of complex humane processes over time. Multilevel Hidden Markov models (MHMM) have been widely used to analyse such data and model latent processes of humane behaviours. However, since in MHMM, the state durations are assumed to follow a geometric distribution, the most probable duration is always 1 which may not be a good reflection of dwell times in real applications. To overcome this limitation, we introduced a novel Multilevel Explicit Duration Hidden Markov model (MEDHMM) that explicitly models the state durations with a log-normal distribution that covers a wider range of possible durations. A Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted to compare the MEDHMM and MHMM in capturing true state durations and estimating other group-level parameters. We concentrated on how the performance of both methods was affected by varying levels of the number of states, observational durations, and state durations. We showed that MEDHMM outperforms the MHMM when longer ($\geq19.5$) or varying across states dwell times are assumed, but it fails to identify true durations and emission parameters for shorter durations ($\leq3.5$). Finally, we showed how the MEDHMM can be applied to empirical data and model the bipolar disorder dynamics.
